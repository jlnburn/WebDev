# Lesson 1 Project
This project will assess your knowledge and skills using the various concepts taught within the lesson. 
1. You will need to create 2 HTML pages that utilize the appropriate semantic elements to achieve the desired goal of the steps. 
2. You will need to style the pages following the directions. 
3. You will need to validate your code to ensure there are no errors or problems.
4. You will need to apply the accessibility best practices you have learned.

## Project Prep
1. If you haven't done so already, clone the repo to your computer within your course folder.
2. Open the repo within VS Code. You can open this `readme.md` file within VS Code to view the project directions there. 
   > *TIP: Right click on the file and choose the `Open Preview` option.*
3. If there are files and folders present other than this `readme.md` file, take some time to familiarize yourself with the files within the repo so you know where they are located. This will help you when asked to use them within the project directions.

> TIP: Before beginning any work on the project, read through all the steps to understand what you will be doing.

   3. Add a metadata element to identify the author as you (i.e., put your name in as the value.)
   4. Create a link to the `main.css` file. 
      > *TIP: Refer to the CSS Styling Directions below to determine the file path.*
5. Save the file and apply a commit to your file.

         > *TIP: If you need additional paragraphs or would like to use additional elements, like lists, you may do so.*
         1. Reflect upon what you learned in this lesson and identify at least three things (elements, concepts, etc.) that were new to you and how you think you may use them in a project?
      3. Create another heading with the text: `My Next Steps`
      4. Create a paragraph and answer the following: 
         > *TIP: If you need additional paragraphs or would like to use additional elements, like lists, you may do so.* 
         1. Reflecting on what you learned, what element or concept do you feel you need to learn more about? Why do you feel that way? What steps do you feel could help you learn more about it?

   6. Within the footer:
      1. Create an unordered list with the following list item: `Lesson Activities`.
      2. Create a nested unordered list with 6 list items. Each list item should be a hyperlink to the HTML files you created during the practice activities you for the lesson. Do not link to the index.html practice activity file.
      > TIP: You can get the URLs to use for the `href` by opening the practice activity repo on GitHub within your browser, navigating to the HTML file, and then copying the URL from the address bar in your browser. You can then repeat this process for each file.
