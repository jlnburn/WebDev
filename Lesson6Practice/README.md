# Lesson 6 Practice Activities
To help build your skillsets and proficiency with the concepts learned in this lesson, complete the following activities. These activities are ungraded, however, they will provide opportunities to explore different scenarios you may come across as you work on projects within the course and your career. The activities will also help prepare you for what you will need to do for the lesson's project assignment and final exam project at the end of the course.

> **Reminder** - If you have questions on how to complete an activity, be sure to save the work you have completed so far, apply commits, and sync the files with GitHub. Then send your instructor a message with your question(s). Refer to the specific file you are working on, so your instructor can to look at the files in your repo and provide you with the necessary guidance.
