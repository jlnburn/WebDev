# Lesson 8 Practice Activities
To help build your skillsets and proficiency with the concepts learned in this lesson, complete the following activities. These activities are ungraded, however, they will provide opportunities to explore different scenarios you may come across as you work on projects within the course and your career. The activities will also help prepare you for what you will need to do for the lesson's project assignment and final exam project at the end of the course.

> **Reminder** - If you have questions on how to complete an activity, be sure to save the work you have completed so far, apply commits, and sync the files with GitHub. Then send your instructor a message with your question(s). Refer to the specific file you are working on, so your instructor can to look at the files in your repo and provide you with the necessary guidance. 

## Activity Prep
Each activity is stored within the subfolders for this repo. Within each folder is another `readme.md` file with the specific instructions and steps you need to follow for that activity.

You will utilize [Google Material icons](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/material_icons) in some of the activities to add icons to a menu. Take some time to become familiar with the site and search for different icons to see what is available to use for your future projects.

### Data Files
The following is a list of data files that you will need for the various activities. Any other files or content beyond this list will need to be created by you.

* `index.html`
* `canvas.html` - starter file for the canvas activity
* `css/style.css`
