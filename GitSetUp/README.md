# GitHub Setup Project

## Scenario
In this project, you will walk through the steps to become familiar with using Git, GitHub, VS Code, applying a commit, syncing your files with GitHub, and submitting assignments to your instructor for your web development course.

## Project Preparation
1. If you have not done so already, create a course folder to store all your practice activities and project files. e.g., CIS233DA-12345.
2. You will find the directions for all your projects and activities within the `Readme.md` file. 
   1. This is a markdown file.
   2. You can view the markdown file in two ways:
      1.  Within GitHub when looking at your repository in a browser. OR
      2.  Open the file within VS Code after you clone the repo to your computer.

## Project Directions
1. Now that you have the repo for this activity, **use GitHub Desktop to clone the repo to your course folder**.
   > If you need a refresher on how to do this, refer to the [How To: Clone a Repo with GitHub Desktop](https://riosalado.coursearc.com/content/cis-public/using-git-and-github/using-git-github-and-vs-code#How-To-Clone-a-Repo-with-GitHub-Desktop) tutorial in the lesson material.
2. Once you have cloned the repo, **open the repo within VS Code**.
   > If you need a refresher on how to do this, refer to the [How To: Open a Repo in VS Code](https://riosalado.coursearc.com/content/cis-public/using-git-and-github/using-git-github-and-vs-code#How-To-Open-a-Repo-in-VS-Code) tutorial in the lesson material.
3. Open this `Readme.md` file in VS Code by right clicking on the file and selecting the **Open Preview** option.
   1. This will let you view the directions in VS Code instead of within GitHub.
   2. You can do this for all future assignments.
   > **VS Code Tip** - You can use the Split View feature (under the **View** menu, **Editor Layout** options) in VS Code to display the `Readme.md` file on one side and the files you need to edit on the other side.
4. Within the `html` subfolder, open the `index.html` file and complete the following steps:
   1. Modify the `title` element to say the following: Setup Project
   2. Modify the level 1 heading so it displays your first and last name.
   3. Modify the list to add your GitHub username, course, section, and instructor's name.
   4. Answer the questions within the list replacing the `Response here` text.
   5. Create a level 2 heading with the following text: My Course Goals
   6. Create at least one new paragraph after the heading and write a brief introduction about yourself. Include what degree you are pursuing, what career you are looking to get into after you graduate, what attracts you to that career, and what you hope to learn in this course.
5. Save the `index.html` file.
6. **Apply a commit** for the changes you made to the HTML file.
   1. A good commit message would be: Added my details to the page
   > If you need a refresher on how to do this, refer to the [How To: Commit Changes in VS Code](https://riosalado.coursearc.com/content/cis-public/using-git-and-github/using-git-github-and-vs-code#How-To-Commit-Changes-in-VS-Code) tutorial in the lesson material.   3. 
7. **Sync your changes** with GitHub.
   > If you need a refresher on how to do this, refer to the [How To: Sync Files with GitHub](https://riosalado.coursearc.com/content/cis-public/using-git-and-github/using-git-github-and-vs-code#How-To-Sync-Files-with-GitHub) tutorial in the lesson material.
8. Submit your assignment to your instructor by placing a comment within the pull request and click on the Comment button. *Be sure to include your instructor's username (with an at symbol `@`) to send the notification (e.g., `@username, {Comment goes here}`). Your instructor's username can be found in a course announcement.*
   > If you need a refresher on how to do this, refer to the [How To: Submit an Assignment](https://riosalado.coursearc.com/content/cis-public/using-git-and-github/submitting-assignments-and-viewing-feedback#How-To-Submit-an-Assignment) tutorial in the lesson material.
   > TIP: If you are on the [GitHub.com](https://github.com/rsc-cis233da-in-v8) website typing in your comment, when you type in the `@` sybmol, a list of potential users to select from will appear to help you easily find your instructor's username.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE** - When you look at the pull request in VS Code or GitHub, you should see the commit you applied in step 6 listed right above the textbox. If you do not see the commit listed there, be sure to go back to step 7 and make sure you sync your files.
