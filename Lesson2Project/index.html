<h2>My Reflection</h2>
<p>Learning more about color modes and transparency. HSL color values are new to me, and I find them to be the most useful tool for working with color yet. It allowed me to mix colors to create a color scheme in the fraction of the time it takes with the other color tools. I found the concept of how the viewing angle of colors, makes them different fascinating. I came across a website, December.com, which has a chart that allows a person to visually compare the hue, saturation, light and alpha values. The box-shadow property is also new to me. It makes a real difference by giving images depth just by casting a shadow, in any direction, including inset. Creating a circle with just a line of code was almost magical. The shorthand properties and values make the task effortless.  I found advanced selectors to be extremely useful, allowing a person to target specific elements with attribute selectors very useful, allowing a person to accomplish some daunting tasks in very little time and effort.</p>
<p>This lesson was like a refresher, from Level 1 Web Development.  I hope I can use the skills I acquired would enhance the visual aspects of my designs, especially working with colors and box-shadows, while advanced selectors could not only help with design, but also with troubleshooting. </p>

<h2>My Next Steps</h2>
<p>I found some aspects of advanced selectors a bit confusing. Specifically attribute selection because there are so many of them. I understand how useful they can be, and I think with a bit more time and practice, I will come to understand them better in the future.</p>
