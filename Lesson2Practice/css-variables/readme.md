# Color Scheme Activity
In this activity, you will create a color scheme for the practice activity site using variables and then apply the colors throughout the site.

## Activity Objectives
1. Create CSS variables for colors.
2. Apply the variables to various elements.
3. Style the elements with CSS.

## Pick Colors
You will need to select colors to use within the color scheme. You can utilize the [Rio Color Tool](https://rsc-media.github.io/colorTool/) to help select the colors. Pick colors for the following:
* A dark background color
* A light background color
* A dark text color
* A light text color
* An accent color

> TIP: Have fun in creating the color scheme. You will create more throughout the course and can create different schemes to use for different projects to help develop the skills about what works well together and what doesn't. When you find a scheme you like, make note of the scheme and keep a list of good color schemes.

## Styling Directions
Use any appropriate selectors and property-value pairs to style the web pages and elements.

1. Open the `main.css` file from the `css` folder.
2. Create the declaration block for the variables as follows:
   1. Create the root pseudo-class selector.
   2. Create custom properties for the 5 colors you picked earlier.
   3. Add the color value to the custom properties.
3. Modify the following elements to use the appropriate variable associated with the identified color(s) - if the property or selector does not exist, create it:
   1. `body` - dark text color
   2. `header` - light background color
   3. `nav` - dark background color
   4. `nav a` - light text color
   5. `nav a:hover` - light background color, dark text color
   6. `footer` - light background color
4. Save and apply a commit to the file.

## Conclusion
When you are done with the activity:
1. Be sure you check for any validation errors and correct them.
2. Sync the files (i.e., push your changes) with the remote repo on GitHub.
