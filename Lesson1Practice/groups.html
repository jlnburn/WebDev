    <h2>Blockquote Example</h2>
    <p>&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; </p>
    <p>The blockquote tag in HTML is used to display long quotations (a section that is quoted from another source). It changes the alignment to make it unique from others. It contains both opening and closing tags. In blockquote tags, we can use elements like headings, lists, paragraphs, etc.
        <blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/bruce_lee_153190?src=t_inspirational">If you always put limit on everything you do, physical or anything else. It will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.        -Bruce Lee

    <h2>Pre Example</h2>
    <p>&lt;pre&gt; &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
    <p>The pre tag defines preformatted text. Text in a &lt;pre&gt; element is displayed in a fixed-width font, and the text preserves both spaces and line breaks. The text will be displayed exactly as written in the HTML source code.</p>

        <b>Ozymandias By Percy Bysshe Shelley</b><br> 
        I met a traveller from an antique land,
        Who said: â€œTwo vast and trunkless legs of stone
        Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,
        Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
        The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed;
        And on the pedestal these words appear:
        "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
        Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"
        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
        Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
        The lone and level sands stretch far away.
        </pre>
