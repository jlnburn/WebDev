# Keyboard Text Activity
In this activity, you will utilize more advanced text-level elements to define the purpose and semantic nature of the text.

## Activity Objectives
1. Create a simple tutorial including keyboard shortcuts.
2. Style the components with CSS.

## Text Element Tutorials Directions
1. Open the `text-elements.html` file.
2. Within the main section, create a level 2 headings with the following text: `Keyboard Element Example`
3. Under the keyboard heading:
   1. Create a paragraph with the following text: `In VS Code, there are many keyboard shortcuts that can be used to perform commands. Using the shortcuts can help improve the efficiency of your work.`
   2. Create an ordered list after the paragraph.
   3. Add the following as individual list items:
      1. `To pull up the Command Palette you can either press the F1 key or the key combination of Ctrl + Shift + P (or CMD + Shift + P on a Mac).`
      2. `To switch to the Explorer panel you can use the key combination of Ctrl + Shift + E (or CMD + Shift + E on a Mac).`
      3. `To switch to the Source Control panel you can use the key combination of Ctrl + Shift + G (or CMD + Shift + G on a Mac).`
      4. `To open and close the Problems view you can use the key combination of Ctrl + Shift + M (or CMD + Shift + M on a Mac).`
   4. Apply the `kbd` element to the keyboard keys within each list item. There are 6 keys in each list item, except for the first one, which has 7 keys.

   2. Apply a background color of `hsl(0, 0%, 88%)`.
   3. Apply a thin, solid, gray border.
