# Quote and Cite Text Activity
In this activity, you will utilize more advanced text-level elements to define the purpose and semantic nature of the text.

## Activity Objectives
1. Add inline quotations and cite the quote.
2. Style the components with CSS.

## Text Element Tutorials Directions
1. Open the `text-elements.html` file.
2. Use the Save As command to save a new file and save it in the same place as the `index.html` file with the name: `text-elements.html`.
3. Within the main section, create a level 2 heading with the following text: `Inline Quotes Example`
4. Under the quote heading:
   1. Create a paragraph with the following text: `One of the most famous movie quotes is, "Luke, I am your father!" The quote is from the movie The Empire Strikes Back. The problem is that it is a misquote of the movie. The character Darth Vader actually said, "No. I am your father."`
   2. Replace the quotation marks with the `q` element.
   3. Add the `cite` element around the film title `The Empire Strikes Back`.
5. Save the file.
6. Apply a commit to the file with the following message: `added inline quote and cite examples`.

## Styling Directions
1. Open the `main.css` file within the `css` folder.
2. Create a selector targeting the cite element and apply the following styles:
   1. Change the text color of `rgb(5, 9, 71)`.
   2. Apply a bolder font weight.
3. Save the file.
4. Apply a commit to the file with the following message: `added cite stylings`
