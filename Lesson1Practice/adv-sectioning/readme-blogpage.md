# Blog Page Activity

In this activity, you will create a web page that will provide the overall structure for a blog article page as a template. You will need to utilize the appropriate elements to achieve the stated steps in the directions.

## Activity Objectives

1. Create a blog article template page.
2. Style the pages with CSS.

## Blog Page Directions

1. If needed, open the `index.html` file.
2. Use the Save As command to save a new file and save it in the same place as the `index.html` file with the name: `blog-template.html`
3. Within the main section of the page:
   1. Create a section for an article. *TIP: Use the specific element dedicated to articles.*
   2. Create a section for a discussion. Apply an `id` of `discussions` to the element.
   3. Create an aside section to be used for placing ads. Apply a `class` of `ad-container` to the element.
4. Save the file.
5. Apply a commit to the file with the following message: `added basic sections`
6. Within the article section:
   1. Create a level 2 heading with the following text: `Article Title`
   2. Create a paragraph with an id of `author`.
      1. Add the following text: `Written by: Article Author`
      2. Place a `span` element around the `Article Author` text and give it an `id` of `author-name`.
   3. Create 3 paragraphs and fill them with lorem ipsum text.
7. Save the file.
8. Apply a commit to the file with the following message: `added article placeholders`
9. Within the discussions section:
   1. Create a level 2 heading with the following text: `Discuss the article`
   2. Add a `div` element with an `id` of `discussion-placeholder`.
10. Save the file.
11. Apply a commit to the file with the following message: `added discussion structures`
12. Within the ad section:
    1.  Create a paragraph with the text `Ads` and a `class` of `ad-notice`
    2.  Add a `div` element with an `id` of `article-ad`
13. Save the file.
14. Apply a commit to the file with the following message: `added ad structures`

## Styling Directions

1. Open the `main.css` file within the `css` folder.
2. Create appropriate selectors and use the necessary properties and values to achieve the following:
   1. Give the discussion placeholder and ad container elements a thin border, padding, width, and height of your choosing so they can be seen and fill the parent element.
   2. Apply a `text-transform` on the ad notice element to have the text appear as uppercase.
   3. Apply any additional styling to the elements that you would like. Use this time to practice applying properties and improving your design skills. For example, font properties, positioning elements, box model properties, etc.
3. Save the file.
4. Apply a commit to the file with the following message: `added styles to div elements`
5. Check to make sure your web pages appear as you expect them to. Make any additional changes you feel are necessary.
6. If you made any changes, save the file(s) and apply a commit with an appropriate message.
