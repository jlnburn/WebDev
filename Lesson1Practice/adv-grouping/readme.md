# HTML Grouping Activity
In this activity, you will create a web page where you will utilize grouping elements to create basic components that can be used in larger projects.

## Activity Objectives
1. Create a blockquote element and stylize it.
2. Create a component where a poem can be inserted.
3. Create a thematic break.

## Activity Preparation
1. Use a search engine and find a quote that you find inspirational. You will use this when you create the blockquote.
2. Use a search engine and find a poem that has at least 3 lines. You will use this for the `pre` example.

## Grouping Page Directions
1. If needed, open the `index.html` file created in the previous practice activity.
2. Use the Save As command to save a new file and save it in the same place as the `index.html` file with the name: `groups.html`
3. In the main section:
   1. Remove the definition list.
   2. Create two level 2 headings. Use the following for the text:
      1. Blockquote Example
      2. Pre Example
   3. Insert a thematic break element between the two headings.
4. Save the file.
5. Apply a commit to the file with the following message: `added headings`
6. Under the blockquote heading:
   1. Create a paragraph and provide a brief description of when a `blockquote` element should be used.
   2. Insert a blockquote element.
   3. Paste the inspirational quote you found during the preparation into the element.
   4. Add the `cite` attribute and add the URL of the site you got the quote from.
7. Save the file.
8. Apply a commit to the file with the following message: `added blockquote content`
9. Under the pre heading:
   1.  Create a paragraph and provide a brief description of when a `pre` element should be used.
   2.  Insert the `pre` element with a class of `poem`.
   3.  Add the poem to the element making sure that each line of the poem is on a separate line.
   4.  Add a paragraph after the pre element and add the text `Source: ` and then create a hyperlink to the site where you got the poem.
10. Save the file.
11. Apply a commit to the file with the following message: `added pre content`

## Styling Directions
1. Open the `main.css` file created in the previous practice activity.
2. Create a selector to target the blockquote element and apply the following styles:
   1. Apply a width of `500px`.
   2. Apply a margin of `auto` to center the element within the section.
   3. Apply a padding of `16px`.
   4. Apply a thin, solid border with a color of `rgb(5, 9, 71)`.
   5. Apply a thick left border width. *TIP: if you place this after the border you created from step 3, then it will override the thin border width to make it thick due to the CSS cascade.*
   6. Change the font size to be `24px`.
   7. Change the font family to one of your choosing.
3. Create a selector for the poem pre element and apply the following styles:
   1. Apply a solid border style
   2. Apply a border color of `hsl(271, 30%, 46%)`.
   3. Apply a border width of `6px` to the top and bottom and a width of `1px` to the left and right of the element.
   4. Add a padding of `12px`.
   5. Apply a width of `50%`.
   6. Add a left margin of `16px`.
   7. Add a background color of `hsl(271, 30%, 95%)`.
4. Save the file.
5. Apply a commit to the file with the following message: `styled blockquote and pre elements`
